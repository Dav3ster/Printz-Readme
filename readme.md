# Printz Readme

## describtion 

This challenge made me more familiar with using node and modules. The Application uses backend JavaScript to create a formal Readme.md file. I also got use to using npm tools such as inquirer to prompt users for answers. Overall it was a cool challenege that showed me how useful some of these tools can be for creating quick solutions to easy tasks.
